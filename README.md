C++ app to get FileSystem information in a faster way

This is just the first commit. I created to refresh my knowledge of C ++.
I used to write fast software in C. So, some old habits of C could exist in this first commit.
Soon I am going to replace the "printf" and do some performance tests with forks.

Let's have fun and coding! : )
